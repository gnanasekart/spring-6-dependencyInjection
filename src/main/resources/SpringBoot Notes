MyConfiguration file
This file contains Bean definitions and configuration settings for a Spring Boot application.


## Bean Annotations
- @Configuration: Indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.
- @Bean: Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
    - Bean name can be specified using the name attribute, else method name is used as the bean name.
- @ComponentScan: Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes.
- @Scope: Specifies the scope of a bean (singleton, prototype, request, session, etc.).
    - Default scope is singleton.
    - Singleton: A single instance/Object per Spring IoC container is created and used in other places.
    - Prototype: A new instance/Object each time the bean is requested.
    - Request: A single instance per HTTP request (web applications).
    - Session: A single instance per HTTP session (web applications).

Exception :-
1). org.springframework.beans.factory.NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException:
        No qualifying bean of type 'org.javaBasedConfiguration.Writer' available:
        expected single matching bean but found 2: pen,pencil

    - This exception occurs when there are multiple beans of the same type and Spring cannot determine which one to inject.
    - To resolve this, you can use @Qualifier annotation to specify which bean to inject. --> First Priority is Qualifier
    @Qualifier("beanName")
    - Alternatively, you can mark one of the beans as @Primary to indicate that it should be the default choice. --> Second Priority is Primary


Stereotype Annotations

@Component: Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example.package"): Specifies the packages to scan for annotated components.
@Autowired: Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities.
@Qualifier("beanName"): Specifies which bean to inject when multiple candidates are available.
@Primary: Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency.


Spring Boot - Convention over Configuration

Dependency Injection
- Constructor Injection:
    @Autowired
    public Student(Pen pen) {
        System.out.println("Constructor Injection called");
        this.pen = pen;
    }

- Setter Injection:
    @Autowired
    public void setPen(Pen pen) {//Setter Injection
        System.out.println("Setter Injection called");
        this.pen = pen;
    }

- Field Injection:
    @Autowired
    private Pen pen;//Field Injection

Autowired


Loose Coupling
- @Primary: Marks a bean as the primary candidate for autowiring when multiple beans of the same type are present.
@Component
@Primary
public class Pen implements Writer
{
    @Override
    public void write() {
        System.out.println("Writing with Pen");
    }
}

- @Qualifier: Specifies which bean to inject when multiple candidates are available.
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("pencil")
    private Writer writer;

To avoid tight coupling between classes, we use interfaces.
Once after implementing the interface method in one class. that particular class denoted with @Component annotation.
Now, in another class, we can use that interface as a reference data type and use @Autowired to inject the implementation class object.

REST API

Client-Server Architecture

Server consist of
- Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- Service Layer: Contains business logic.
- Repository Layer: Manages data access and persistence.
